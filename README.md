# Savitzky_Golay_Filter
Demonstration of the Savitzky Golay filter on some provided sample data. This filter was applied in c++, plotted using gnuplot, and verified using Matlab

# Motivation
An assignment for school (Predictive and Artifical Intelligence)

# File details
## Savitzky_Golay_filter.cpp


## Savitzky_Golay_filter.m:
This matlab code applies the Savitzky–Golay filter using the sgolay function. It sas used to verify the code produced in c++ using the Eigen library

## gnuplot_script_smooth_filter.txt
Code to plot the filtered data. Enter  *load "gnuplot_script_smooth_filter.txt"* in gnuplot to run the script

## sample_data.txt


# Code Style & Installation
Coded in c++. Compilation can be done via the command "g++ Reinforcment_Learning_Policy_Iteration.cpp"

# External Libraries/tools Used
The Library Eigen was utilized for this project and the tool gnuplot was used for plotting the outputted data
